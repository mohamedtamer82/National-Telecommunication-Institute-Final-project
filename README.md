# National-Telecommunication-Institute-Final-project
Flight Price Prediction

This project was developed as my final training project at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI).
The goal is to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple features such as:

🛫 Source and destination cities

📅 Date and time of the flight

⏱ Duration of the trip

🔁 Number of stops

🏷️ Other flight details

By analyzing these factors, the model can help travelers and businesses estimate flight prices more accurately.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python (data processing & modeling)

Pandas, NumPy (data cleaning & manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (exploratory data analysis & visualization)

Scikit-learn / XGBoost (machine learning models)

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Multiple machine learning models compared

Price prediction for unseen flights

🌐 Deployment – deployed interactive app using Streamlit
