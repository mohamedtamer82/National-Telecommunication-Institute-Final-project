# National-Telecommunication-Institute-Final-project
Flight Price Prediction

This project was developed as my final training project at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI).
The goal is to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple features such as:

🛫 Source and destination cities

📅 Date and time of the flight

⏱ Duration of the trip

🔁 Number of stops

🏷️ Other flight details

By analyzing these factors, the model can help travelers and businesses estimate flight prices more accurately.

🔑 Main Steps

🧹 Data Cleaning – handled missing values and inconsistencies

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – discovered patterns and insights

🛠️ Feature Engineering – extracted features (month, day, duration, stops, etc.)

⚙️ Data Preprocessing – encoded categorical data & scaled numerical values

🤖 Model Training – trained and compared six ML models

📊 Visualization – plotted insights for feature impact

🌐 Deployment – deployed interactive app using Streamlit

📈 Results

Achieved an accuracy of 84%

Compared multiple models for performance

Identified key features affecting flight prices

🔧 Technologies Used

Python (data processing & modeling)

Pandas, NumPy (data cleaning & manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (exploratory data analysis & visualization)

Scikit-learn / XGBoost (machine learning models)

🌐 Deployment – deployed interactive app using Streamlit
